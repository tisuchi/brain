# List of Laravel Packages

Here is the list of #laravel-packages that I like mostly.

## Tried already
- [Laravel Debugbar: Debug your code, find db queries, issues, memory uses and more...](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
- [Larastan: helping you to find errors in your code](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan)
- [Laravel IDE Helper Generator: Mostly for completing PHPDocs, directly from the source](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper)

## Haven't try yet (sounds promising)
- [⚡️ Laravel Actions: organising the logic of your Laravel applications](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions)
